    <h1>Naked Eggs Benedict</h1>
    <img src="./naked-eggs-benedict.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These naked eggs Benedict are a stripped-down version that involves no poaching of eggs, 
        and they are not covered in heavy Hollandaise sauce, but are sauced with a lighter lemon 
        butter sauce. And yet, the taste is virtually identical to classic eggs Benedict.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons melted butter</li>
        <li>4 round or oval slices deli ham (about 2 ounces)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 (5 ounce) ramekins (or 2 wells
            of a standard muffin tin) with melted butter.</li>
       <li>Line each ramekin with two slices of ham, being sure to get the edges even around the top. </li>
       <li>Crack 1 egg into a small bowl; gently transfer to a ham-lined ramekin; repeat with the seco
           nd egg. Season each egg with salt and cayenne, to taste.    </li>
       <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the whites are just barely set, and the yolks are still soft and
            a little runny, 20 to 25 minutes. The eggs will continue to cook and set more firmly once 
            removed from the oven if left in the hot ramekins.</li>
    </ol>
